## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

  * Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher ☕
  * Node.js and npm (or yarn) 📦
  * PostgreSQL installed and running 💾
  * Maven ⚙️

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/baidya-ripan-024/task-management.git
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**

      * Navigate into each microservice directory (e.g., `user-service`, `task-service`).
      * Configure `application.properties` or `application.yml` with your PostgreSQL database credentials and other service-specific settings.
      * Build each service:
        ```bash
        cd <microservice-directory>
        mvn clean install
        ```
      * Run each service:
        ```bash
        mvn spring-boot:run
        ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**

      * Navigate to the `organize-frontend` directory.
      * Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        # or yarn install
        ```
      * Start the development server:
        ```bash
        npm start
        # or yarn start
        ```


## 💡 Usage

Once both the backend services and the frontend are up and running, simply open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port where your React app is running). From there, you can register, log in, and start efficiently managing your tasks\! ✨
